### **Why This Section?**
Everyday Insights is where I share the **human side** of my journey:
- **Student-Life-Tips** helps others navigate the challenges of **advanced self-study and project work**.
- **Me-Too** is my platform to **critique, celebrate, and question** the tech world’s direction.
Both reflect my belief that **ethics, ecology, and personal growth** are as important as technical skill.
